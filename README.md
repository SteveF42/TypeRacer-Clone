# TypeRacer-Clone

# tech stack
NodeJS MongoDB ReactJS and express

# Desciption
A rectreation of the well known type game "Type Racer." My goal is to try and recreate the base idea of the game while adding my own twist

# Setup on local machine
clone the project and cd into the backend folder and run "npm install" to install all the dependencies
do the same with the backend folder and run "npm install"

mongoDB or some database will need to be connected to in the .env file
I'll leave a text document where it contains some text that the user will need to type out.
